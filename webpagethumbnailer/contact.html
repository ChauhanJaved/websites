            <li><strong>I am having ordering difficulties. How can I get help?</strong> <br/>
              Please complete the order by fax or phone and Plimus will manually process your order, or send an email to sales@bluesnap.com 
              with a brief description of the situation, or you can phone 1-866-4PLIMUS (toll free in the US and Canada) or +1-858-350-7473 
              (international).</li>
            <li><strong>I have purchased license but still haven't received my registration key. When will I get it?</strong> <br/>
              All information regarding your order, including license key(s), are sent to you via email within minutes of your payment being accepted. However, sometimes this email may be caught by your &quot;Spam Protection&quot; tool, or may be automatically sent to your &quot;Junk&quot; folder. Please be sure to check those locations if you don't receive the email shortly. If you do not receive this email please contact us, include as many details about your order as possible so that we can better help you. </li>
            <li><strong>Why was my order declined?</strong><br/>
              When the message "Credit card was declined" appears while processing an order it means that your credit card bank has 
              declined the transaction, usually a quick call to your credit card bank's customer service will clarify most of the issues. 
              If problems persist, you can use the Fax or Mail payment options to have your order processed. </li>
            <li><strong>I would like to use a Purchase Order. How do I proceed?</strong><br/>
              Purchase Orders are only accepted for orders exceeding $100.00. When you reach the order form, select the "Purchase Order" 
              option from the field labeled "Method of payment". This will generate a printable Invoice, which contains all the 
              information you will need to prepare your Purchase Order. Please note that the supplier/vendor name on the document MUST BE 
              Plimus.</li>
            <li><strong>I want to pay by wire transfer and needs your bank details.</strong><br/>
              Select "Wire" as payment method in the order form. After clicking the "Next" button, you will be taken to a page with detailed instructions, including your order reference number and the bank details for your payment.</li>
