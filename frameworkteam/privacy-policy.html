					<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
				</header>
				<div class="description wow fadeInUp">
					<p>FrameworkTeam Softwares and its websites are committed to respecting and safeguarding the privacy of the personal information very seriously and strictly conform to data protection laws. Personal data is being collected on this website only to the extent necessary for technical reasons. By no means will the collected data be sold or for any other reason given to third parties. The following statement gives you an overview of how we ensure this protection and what kind of data is being collected for what purpose.</p>
					<div class="mainpoints">Website</div>					
					<p>You can visit most areas of the FrameworkTeam’s websites without disclosing any personal information.</p>
					<p>FrameworkTeam only logs the domain name, IP address and browser type of our website visitors via our web server log files and analytics tools at irregular intervals. We use this information to log global access to our website.</p>
					<p>For certain features we will ask that you provide FrameworkTeam certain information so that it works properly. You can decide at any time whether you would like to continue with an instruction prompting you to provide information. In some cases, you will be unable to complete a particular step in the process if you do not want to provide the information requested. For example, we will ask for personal information in the following instances:</p>
					<p>If you place an order through our online store, we will ask you to provide information required for processing the order. This may include your name, address, email address, and credit card number or bank details.</p>
					<div class="mainpoints">Cookies</div>
					<p>Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer or in your browser. Cookies are loaded on your browser when you first use a product or service.</p>
					<p>Cookies do not include any personal information. We may use cookies to identify the browser you are using so that our website displays properly. We also use cookies in various places on our website in order to document your visit to the FrameworkTeam’s website and allow for a more efficient website design. If you do not want to allow FrameworkTeam or someone else to use cookies, you can disable cookie installation via your browser setting. While you also have the option of deleting cookies from your computer’s hard disk at any time, if you choose to do so, you may be unable to use some of the features of our website, products and services.</p>
					<div class="mainpoints">Google Analytics</div>
					<p>FrameworkTeam uses the following third-party analytics tools to better understand your interaction with our website and use of our products/services. Our ultimate goal is to create a more user-friendly experience for you:</p>
					<p>FrameworkTeam uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service from Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses Cookies to make it possible to analyse your use of our website. Information about your use of our website the Cookie generates is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and saved there. However, before this happens, Google shortens and anonymizes your IP address (Google’s anonymize IP process) if located within a member state of the European Union or in other contracting member states to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. The entire IP address is transferred to a Google server in the USA and saved there only in exceptional cases.</p>
					<p>This anonymization ensures that your IP address cannot be traced back to you. Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website in order to compile reports about website activities for FrameworkTeam and provide additional services associated with website and Internet usage. Google can transfer this information to third parties, where appropriate, if legally mandated or if Google contracts with third parties to process such data. Google will not associate your IP address with other Google data. By using our website, you expressly consent to Google’s collection and storage of your data in the manner and for the purposes described above. You also have the option to prevent Google from acquiring and processing data generated by Cookies and data related to your use of our website (including your IP address) by downloading and installing a Google-provided browser plugin.</p>
					<div class="mainpoints">Placing an order</div>
					<p>When you place an order from our Website, it is processed by one of the third party payment processors we use: BlueSnap and FastSpring. They collect personally identifiable information such as your full name, company, email address, phone number, physical address, IP address, payment method and credit card information, to be able to process your payment and issue an invoice. You can consult their individual privacy policies to see how they store and process your data:</p>

				  </br>
					<a href="https://fastspring.com/privacy/" target="_blank">Fastspring's Privacy Policy</a>
					</p>
					<p>None of the payment processors send the payment details to us, we do not receive or record any payment details. We receive the following information from the payment processors: full name, company, email address, phone number, physical address, IP address and payment method. We use these details to deliver you the license key and provide you customer support.</p>
					<div class="mainpoints">Changes to this Privacy Policy</div>
					<p>FrameworkTeam may update Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
